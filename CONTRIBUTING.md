# Contributing

Thank you for working on goat. This page is the whole process; nothing else is required reading before your first pull request.

## The short version

1. Fork, or branch from `main` if you have write access. Branch names: `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `docs/<topic>`.
2. Make the change. Run the gates that apply (below). Add or update the design document in the same change when behaviour or topology changes.
3. Commit with a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) subject and a DCO sign-off: `git commit -s -m "fix(zenoh): …"`.
4. Open a pull request against `main`. Fill the template. One approving review from a code owner merges it, by squash.

## Commits

- **Conventional Commits.** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, with a scope in parentheses naming the component (`feat(goatbuilder): …`). The subject is ≤ 100 characters and says what changed, in the imperative.
- **DCO sign-off on every commit** (`git commit -s`). By signing off you certify the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/): you wrote the change or have the right to submit it under this project's licence. There is no CLA. The policy is in [Policy](#policy).
- **Signed commits** are required on `main`; set up [SSH or GPG commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification) once.
- One logical change per pull request. Refactors and behaviour changes are separate pull requests.

## Gates

Every CI check is a script you can run locally before you push. The ones that apply to most changes:

| Change touches | Run |
|---|---|
| anything | `ops/ci/check-no-identity-spillage.sh` · `ops/ci/check-no-live-secret.sh` — no keys, addresses or credential values in a committed file |
| Rust (`crates/`) | `cd crates && cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace` |
| Go (`ops/*/go.mod`) | `go vet ./... && go test ./...` in that module |
| Ansible | `ops/ci/check-role-template-refs-resolve.sh` · `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` on the playbook you changed |
| Shell | `shellcheck` · `ops/ci/check-bash-portability.sh` (scripts must run on bash 3.2) |
| Docs | `ops/ci/check-doc-links.py` · `ops/ci/check-doc-code-citations.sh` — every `path:line` citation must point at an existing line |
| An ADR | add its row to `docs/adr/INDEX.md` in the same change; ADRs are never rewritten, they are superseded |

The pull-request workflow runs the same scripts. A red gate names the script, so the fix is reproducible locally.

## Design documents

A change to a component's behaviour, data flow, topology or integration point updates that component's design document under `docs/design/` **in the same pull request**. Each design document states, per part, whether it is *built*, *designed* or *not built*, and the status words mean exactly that:

| Word | Means |
|---|---|
| built | the code exists and runs |
| measured | a command ran and produced the stated result |
| designed | decided, not implemented |
| not built | nothing exists |

A load-bearing decision — one a later contributor would need to know the reason for — is an ADR under `docs/adr/`, with a plain-language summary at the top.

## Review

Reviewers look for: the change does what its subject says and nothing else; the gates pass; the design document moved with the code; status words are honest; no identifier of a real deployment (an address, a hostname, a key, a person) entered the tree. Review comments are about the change, not the author.

## Reporting a bug or proposing a feature

Open an issue with the template. For a vulnerability, **do not open an issue** — follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Policy

### 1. Introduction

The project maintainer for this Project will only accept contributions using the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 located at [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org) ("DCO"). The DCO is a legally binding statement asserting that you are the creator of your contribution, or that you otherwise have the authority to distribute the contribution, and that you are intentionally making the contribution available under the license associated with the Project ("License").

### 2. Developer Certificate of Origin Process

Before submitting contributing code to this repository for the first time, you'll need to sign a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) (see below). To agree to the DCO, add a `Signed-off-by` line to every commit with `git commit -s`. At a high level, signing off tells us that you have the right to submit the work you're contributing and indicates that you consent to our treating the contribution in a way consistent with the license associated with this software (as described in [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [INTENT.md](INTENT.md)) and its documentation ("Project").

### 3. Important Points

Pseudonymous or anonymous contributions are permissible, but you must be reachable at the email address provided in the Signed-off-by line.

If your contribution is significant, you are also welcome to add your name and copyright date to the source file header.

U.S. Federal law prevents the government from accepting gratuitous services unless certain conditions are met. By submitting a pull request, you acknowledge that your services are offered without expectation of payment and that you expressly waive any future pay claims against the U.S. Federal government related to your contribution.

If you are a U.S. Federal government employee and use a `*.mil` or `*.gov` email address, we interpret your Signed-off-by to mean that the contribution was created in whole or in part by you and that your contribution is not subject to copyright protections.
